Just make the above corrections and update the skills page and then I'll take one more look at it and hopefully there will be no further changes required right now.

Then we will need to test it, especially the statements page where they must contribute 100 words to submit. We need to figure out how that will work. It should be a 'minimum' of 100 probably.
