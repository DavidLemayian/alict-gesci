##About ALICT 

African Leadership in ICT (ALICT) is an African Union Commission initiative, supported by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and implemented by GESCI (Founded by the UN ICT Task Force).

ALICT is being implemented across eight African cuntries: Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Botswana, Namibia and Mozambique. This second phase of implementation will conclude at the end of May 2013. ALICT was successfully implemented across five African countries between January and August 2012: Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia and Mauritius.

##Rationale for ALICT course

Policy incoherence and misalignment in the Education, ICT, Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) sectors, and a lack of effective leadership to address this issue, has been identified as one of the greatest obstacles to the development of knowledge societies in Africa. Socio-economic development depends on well developed and implementable Education, ICT and STI policies that compliment one another and advance each sectorâ€™s goals. The ALICT course will build the capacity of future African leaders to contribute effectively to the development of knowledge societies by imparting new leadership skills to them. These new leadership skills will provide participants with the attitudes, ideas, management tools, and strategies to act as change agents, assisting their ministries and organisations to develop coherent and well aligned polices in Education, ICT and STI.
